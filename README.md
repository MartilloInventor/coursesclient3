Some more relevant info about the Clojure environment is found in ClojureDiscussion.pdf, in which some questions were answered on the [Cursive Mailing List](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/cursive) about mixed language Clojure programming and the use of the Intellij Cursive plugin.

Two other mailing lists useful for Clojure programming are [Clojure](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/clojure) and [Clojure Dev](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/clojure-dev)

_IDE and Tools_

I found two Intellij plugins: Cursive and Closure-Kit. Neither seems to work correctly with the current version of intellij.
 
Thus I cannot consider this problem to be a true assignment. It is better just to take a look at the pom.xml, CoursesClientRequest.java, and CoursesClientRequest.clj to see what I did to get Java and Closure to interoperate.

I will spend sometime later to get these plugins to work properly. (Maybe someone has already done the work, and I just did not find the correct plugins by googling.)

Getting these plugins to work is important because there is probably a great deal of usefulness in Clojure for NLP, medical software engineering, financial software engineering, and legal software engineering.

I chose the Cursive plugin, which worked better than Closure-Kt.

Then I created the Clojure module and from there I created the src.edu.webdev.CoursesClientRequest.clj namespace.

The (ns) sexpr maps the Clojure namespace to a Java class.

It seems to be necessary to mark Intellij (test) sources root manually.

Breakpoints currently don't seem to work properly.

The builtin editor seems to misbehave. I edited with emacs and let Intellij automatically discover modifications of .clj files.

Because I am creating executable JARs, it was important to make sure the run/debug configuration specified JAR application.

Intellij seems to have been slow in discovering changes to Clojure modules.

I tended to use maven lifecyle clean and build Clojure modules manually (there was only one) and then invoke maven lifecyle install.

The red error indicator appears in the upper right corner of the s.e.w.CourseClientRequest window because the Clojure parser seems unable to distinguish between a Java method named get and the Clojure/core get function. This error indicator does not prevent compilation.

**Specific Issues**

_Getting the class in Clojure._

Clojure does not have the equivalent of Java ".class", but the class function (comparable to Scala classOf) can be applied to a Java object.

_Clojure versus GenericType_

There is nothing like the following in Clojure.
````
    new GenericType<List<String>>() {}
````
Thus I had to pass the above as a Java object to the Clojure functions.
````
    public void invokeMethod() {
        // clojure.core ns is read by default -- get require
        // then read edu.webdev.clojure.CoursesClientRequest
        IFn require = Clojure.var( "clojure.core", "require" );
        require.invoke( Clojure.read( "src.edu.webdev.CoursesClientRequest" ) );
        // Invoke foo method in src.edu.webdev.edu.CoursesClientRequest.clj
        IFn foo = Clojure.var( "src.edu.webdev.CoursesClientRequest", "doCoursesClientRequest" );
        foo.invoke( "AOK", new GenericType<List<String>>() {} );
    }
````
I'm not sure the namespace definition (ns) code is exactly correct, but the program seems to work.
````
(ns src.edu.webdev.CoursesClientRequest
  (:gen-class
    :name CoursesClientRequest
    :methods [#^{:static true} [doCoursesClientRequest [String] Void]]))
````
Note that the accept method below takes a variable number of arguments.

Checkout how I pass the argument to it in the following function definition.
````
(defn sendGetRequest
  [s me log gtls]
  (if (not (nil? s))
    (do
      (. log (debug "arguments: {} {}" s (. me (toString))))
      (. log (debug "webresource: {}" (.. me
                                          (resource (str applicationServiceURI s))
                                          (toString))))
      (. log (debug "builder: {}" (.. (. me (resource (str applicationServiceURI s)))
                                      (accept (into-array (list "application/json")))
                                      (toString))))
      (try
        (let [webResource (. me (resource (str applicationServiceURI s)))
              response (.. webResource
                           (accept (into-array (list "application/json")))
                           (get com.sun.jersey.api.client.ClientResponse))]
          (if (not (== (. response (getStatus)) 200))
            (throw (new RuntimeException
                        (str "Failed : HTTP error code : "
                             (. response (getStatus))))))
          ; note post-fix . instead of new
          (println (into [] (java.util.ArrayList.
                              (. response (getEntity gtls))))))
        (catch Exception e (. e (printStackTrace)) (println (str "could not send: " (.getMessage e))))))
    (throw (new RuntimeException "Bad URI"))))
````
The various Java JSON reading and decoding libraries depend on constructs like GenericType above. It really does not fit very well with culture. It might be worthwhile to create a pure Clojure library to implement JAX-RS and Jersey clients without invoking methods from Java JARs.
